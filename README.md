# Palmoria-HR-Analytics
Power BI project analyzing HR data for gender equality, salary compliance, and performance trends at Palmoria Group.

## Project Topic: Gender Equality & Compensation Analysis – Palmoria Group

### Project Overview
This report provides a gender-focused analysis of Palmoria Group’s HR data, including Gender distribution, Salary equity, Performance Ratings and compliance with regulatory pay benchmarks. Findings highlight key areas requiring immediate attention and offer recommendations to support a more inclusive and equitable workplace.

### Data Source
This Data was provided by The Incubator Hub as part of the final project requirements for the Digital SkillUp Africa Program

### Tools Used
- Power Query (For data cleaning and transformation)
- Power BI (For creating a report)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of Data cleaning and preparation, the following actions are performed;
1. Data Transformation and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
1. What is the Gender distribution in the organization?
2. Are salaries equitably distributed?
3. What are the insights on Performance Rating?
4. Is the organization compliant with regulatory Pay benchmarks?

### Key Insights
**Gender Representation**: Across Palmoria’s three locations, male employees make up 49% of the workforce, female employees 46% and Generic employees (employees whose gender could not be ascertained at the time of writing this report) made up the remaining 5% of the total workforce in Palmoria. This imbalance is especially pronounced in the Kaduna branch which has a male workforce of 50% as opposed to its 45% female workforce and in departments like Sales and Legal across board. 

**Performance Ratings**: 71 Employees were originally marked as ‘Not Rated’ and were reassigned to ‘Average’ for consistency in bonus allocation and analysis. As a result, there is a slight skew in the distribution of performance ratings. Although ratings appear fairly distributed across genders, a deeper look reveals that 71 employees were initially ‘Not Rated’ – a large number of whom were women. This suggests a potential lack of visibility or engagement in the appraisal process for female employees, which could impact bonuses, promotions, and morale.

**Gender Pay Gap**: There is a clear gender-based pay gap across multiple departments and branches. Across branches, the average salary for male employees exceeds that of females by 4%. This discrepancy remains even within the same job roles and ratings. Although all departments and regions are in need of a complete salary overhaul, departments like Human Resources, Product Management, Sales, Services and Business Development and Abuja Region should be the focus of management.

**Salary Compliance**: A whopping 69% of total employees across all 3 branches of Palmoria Group are paid below the regulatory minimum of 90,000, with most of them based in the Abuja Branch of the company. This non-compliance could expose Palmoria to legal and reputational risks.

### Recommendations
**To address the issues mentioned above, I recommend:***
- Target inclusive hiring and gender diversity in underrepresented branches and departments.
- Standardize performance review processes and train managers to minimize bias
- Conduct a gender pay audit and correct unfair salary differences
- Ensure all employees undergo performance appraisals to enable fair bonus eligibility
- Review compliance with national payments regulations across all branches and departments
